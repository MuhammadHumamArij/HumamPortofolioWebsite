      Introducing, I am Muhammad Humam Arij, a graphic designer with a great
      interest in the creative world and technology. I graduated from Bina Nusa
      Slawi Vocational School majoring in Multimedia, and currently continuing my
      studies at the Open University majoring in Information Systems.
      <br />
      <br />
      With an educational background in multimedia and information technology, I
      am used to working on various graphic design projects, ranging from logo
      making, social media design, posters, to other visual needs. In addition, I
      also continue to develop my skills in the digital field, including
      understanding how design can be aligned with the needs of today&#039;s
      information systems and technology.
      <br />
      <br />
      For me, design is not just about appearance, but how to create visual works
      that can convey messages effectively, attractively, and according to
      purpose. I always try to produce designs that are simple, strong, and easily
      understood by the audience.
      <br />
      <br />
      If you are interested in working together or would like to discuss design
      ideas, please feel free to contact me at.
